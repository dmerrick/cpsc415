# Link Aggregator (Alpha)
This is where we put stuff for Professor Richards to read.

## Project info
The purpose of this project is to create a link aggregation page, similar to sites such as [digg](http://digg.com) and [reddit](http://reddit.com).

A user will be able to submit a link with a given title, and the project will add it to its database. Other users can then "upvote" or "downvote" the link, which will change its position on the list.

## Current status
At the moment, this is just an online copy of the BankAccounts lab. Our goal is to modify this project to work as the link aggregator.

(Github also serves as a good way to manage the BankAccount project's progress.)
